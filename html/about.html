	<h1>About Frogs</h1>
	<hr>
	<h2>Frogs</h2>
	<p class="info">A frog is a small, tailless and amphibious animal, that most likely date back from 265 million years ago. They are mainly carnivorous animals. An adult frog has a sticky tongue, protruding eyes and limbs folded underneath. They are known for jumping high, making croaking noises and catching bugs with their long tongues. The majority of frogs like in fresh water and on dry land, but some species are adapted for living underground or in trees. There are around 7,300 recorded species of frogs, but only 3 will be touched on on this website. </p>

	<h2>Poison Dart Frog</h2>
	<p class="info">Poison dart frogs are a type of frog native to Central and South America. Their size ranges anywhere from 1.5 cm in length to 6 cm in length. Almost all of them are brightly colored, to warn predators of their toxicity. Adults lay their eggs in any moist place, which icludes leaves and plants. Once they hatch, the adult takes the tadpoles to suitable water (more information on tadpoles later). Some poison dart frogs, such as the golden poison dart frog, have enough toxin on average to kill a 10 men. Otherwise, many poison dart frogs do not pose very much risk to humans.</p>
