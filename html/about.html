		<h1>About Frogs</h1>
		<hr>
		<h2>Frogs</h2>
		<p class="info">A frog is a small, tailless and amphibious animal, that most likely date back from 265 million
			years ago. They are mainly carnivorous animals. An adult frog has a sticky tongue, protruding eyes and limbs
			folded underneath. They are known for jumping high, making croaking noises and catching bugs with their long
			tongues. The majority of frogs like in fresh water and on dry land, but some species are adapted for living
			underground or in trees. There are around 7,300 recorded species of frogs, but only 3 will be touched on on
			this website. </p>

		<h2>Poison Dart Frog</h2>
		<p class="info">Poison dart frogs are a type of frog native to Central and South America. Their size ranges
			anywhere from 1.5 centimetres in length to 6 centimetres in length. Almost all of them are brightly colored,
			to warn predators of their toxicity. Adults lay their eggs in any moist place, which icludes leaves and
			plants. Once they hatch, the adult takes the tadpoles on their back to suitable water (more information on
			tadpoles later). Some poison dart frogs, such as the golden poison dart frog, have enough toxin on average
			to kill 10 men. Besides that, many poison dart frogs do not pose very much risk to humans.</p>

		<h2>Goliath Frog</h2>
		<p class="info">The goliath frog is the largest living frog. They can grow up to 32 centimetres in length (not
			including legs), and sometimes weigh 3.25 kilograms. They can normally be found in rivers with sandy bottoms
			in Middle African countries, such as Cameroon and Equitorial Guinea. They have very acute hearing and fully
			webbed toes. Despite their large adult size, their eggs and tadpoles are roughly the same size as the ones
			of other frogs. They can live for up to 15 years in the wild. Sadly, the numbers of goliath frogs in the
			wild are going down due to habitat destruction and its collection for food and the pet trade.</p>

		<h2>Telmatobius Culeus, or the Scrotum Frog</h2>
		<p class="info">Telmatobius culues, or the scrotum frog of Lake Titicaca, is a medium to large and endangered
			species of frog. The only place you'll find it is Lake Titicaca, and it's entirely aquatic. It gained its
			unfortunate nickname because of its excessive amounts of skin flaps and folds. It's extra skin helps the
			frog respire in the cold water that it lives in. They are among the largest frogs in the world, with a
			length of about 20 centimetres (not including legs). Scrotum frogs are officially classified as endangered,
			due to over-collecting for human consumption, pollution and newly introduced trout to Lake Titicaca. </p>

		<h2>Tadpoles</h2>
		<p class="info">A tadpole is the larval stage in the the life cycle of a frog. Unlike the frogs that they
			metamorphose into, they have gills and tails. Frog tadpoles are solely aquatic. During their metamorphosis,
			their diet changes and they begin to breathe air. As touched on before, some species of frogs lay their eggs
			on plants, and piggyback the tadpoles to water when they hatch. </p>
